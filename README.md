# Deep-Learning

Projects implementing various neural network structures on a variety of Image Classification, Text Analysis and Dataset Modelling including CNNs, RNNs, Autoencoders and GANs.


AUTOENCODERS FROM SCRATCH
https://github.com/akhil9650/Deep-Learning/blob/main/Autoencoders.ipynb

Use of Autoencoders to generate digits from MNIST data, going through multiple iterations of training epochs to generate believable images that perform well on the RMSE criteria.

AUTOENCODERS FOR FLOWERS DATA
https://github.com/akhil9650/Deep-Learning/blob/main/autoencoder_flowers.ipynb

Useof Autoencoders to generate flowers from MNIST data. 
The dataset for the same could be found at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/1ECTVN
Download and extract data in the notebook folder separated in test and train folders.
